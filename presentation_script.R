# Hi Dr. Ryan,
# Here are the commands I used in class:
mammoths() # mammoths growth w/o intervention j0 100, a0 = 80, t = 15
main() # simulation j0 = 100, a0 = 80, t = 15
print_sim() # print simulation
final() # second simulation and print it j0 = 150, a0 = 100, t = 15

# To do your own simulation, run the command:
# main(j=#, a=#, t=#, fun=0)
# print_sim()
# the variables are:
# j = initial number of juveniles in patch one
# a = initial number of juveniles in patch one
# t = number of timesteps
# fun = 0 suppresses some of the sillier messages
